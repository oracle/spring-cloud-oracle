# Oracle Spring Boot Sample for JSON Relational Duality Views

This sample application demonstrates how to use the Oracle Spring Boot Starter JSON Collections with [JSON Relational Duality Views](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/jsnvu/overview-json-relational-duality-views.html)

The Oracle Spring Boot Sample for JSON Relational Duality Views package includes the following components to demonstrate development with JSON Relational Duality Views from a Spring Boot Java context:

- Entities for JSON Relational Duality Views (Student, Enrollment, Course, Lecture Hall)
- Services to interact with the JSON Relational Duality Views
- A SQL script that initializes the database, including the JSON Relational Duality Views.
- A comprehensive test that uses Spring Boot services to manipulate data from JSON Relational Duality Views.

## Run the sample application

The sample application test uses Testcontainers, and creates a temporary Oracle Free container database, and requires a docker runtime environment.

To run the test application, run the following command:

```shell
mvn test
```
