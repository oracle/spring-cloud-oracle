# Oracle Database Spring Boot Samples

The Oracle Database Spring Boot Samples module provides a suite of comprehensive Spring Boot sample applications designed to enable developers with example code for application development.

### [Oracle UCP with JPA Sample](./oracle-spring-boot-sample-ucp-jpa/README.md)

The Oracle UCP with JPA sample application demonstrates how to use the Oracle Spring Boot Starter UCP with Spring Data JPA, connecting your Oracle Database with powerful ORM abstractions that facilitate rapid development, all while using the best connection pooling library for Oracle Database with Spring Boot.

### [JSON Relational Duality Views Sample](./oracle-spring-boot-sample-json-duality/README.md)

The JSON Relational Duality Views sample application demonstrates how to use the Oracle Spring Boot Starter JSON Collections with [JSON Relational Duality Views](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/jsnvu/overview-json-relational-duality-views.html). JSON Relational Duality Views layer the advantages of JSON document-style database over existing relational data structures — Powerful JSON views with full CRUD capabilities can be created on relational database schemas, nesting related data into a single document with unified access.

### [OKafka Sample](./oracle-spring-boot-starter-okafka/README.md)

This sample application demonstrates how to use the Oracle Spring Boot Starter OKafka with the [Kafka Java Client for Oracle Transactional Event Queues](https://github.com/oracle/okafka)

Using an in-database message broker like TxEventQ eliminates the need for external message brokers, reduces overall network traffic, simplifying your overall application architecture — and the OKafka library enables developers to create applications for TxEventQ using familiar Kafka APIs for messaging.
