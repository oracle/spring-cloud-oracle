# Spring Cloud Oracle

Many Oracle customers make extensive use of Spring in their environments. They use Oracle Database and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services. Oracle Database is available in OCI, Azure, GCP and AWS, making it a true multi-cloud database, or available on-premises, including in containers and Kubernetes. Oracle is trusted by many of the world’s top businesses, governments and other organizations to protect their most sensitive data.

*Spring Cloud Oracle* provides tools and services to integrate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Software with the Spring ecosystem in an idiomatic and flexible manner It is designed to simplify microservices development that uses Oracle Database, middleware, and messaging on Oracle and non-Oracle clouds as well as on-premises.

Spring Cloud Oracle (OCI) 1.4.2 is the most recent release which brings together in one place Spring Boot Starters, autoconfiguration and sample code for Oracle Database and OCI services.

Spring Cloud Oracle goes beyond simply wrapping the OCI APIs in starters and adds idiomatic ways to integrate with Spring including for example the ability to use OCI Vault as a Spring Property Source and OCI Object Storage as a Spring Resource provider. We also provide Spring CLI integration with a project catalog to help you create Spring Boot projects using Oracle.

The following sub-projects are included in Spring Cloud Oracle:

## Some key features

- Compatible with Spring Boot, using Spring Boot 3.4.5
- Support for several common OCI services including Object Storage, Functions, Logging, Notifications, Queues, Streaming, Email Delivery, Vault, Autonomous Database and Generative AI (for embeddings and inferencing)
- Improved autoconfiguration for Spring Boot Starters for Oracle Database, and support for Oracle Database 23ai
- Implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream API for Oracle Database Transactional Event Queues
- OCI service components are built on top of OCI SDK for Java and a core module provides OCI configuration and authentication support

## Roadmap

Spring Cloud Oracle has a strong and constantly evolving roadmap as we work to provide comprehensive up-to-date coverage. Right now, we are working on the following updates:

- OpenRewrite recipes to ease migration from HikariCP to Oracle Universal Connection Pool
- Further simplification of running Spring Boot applications as OCI Functions, including as native images using GraalVM Native Image compilation
- Further improvement of the idiomatically of OCI Service modules and the expansion of adoption of the Spring Template pattern
- Additional Spring CLI project templates and example applications, particularly in the Spring AI space, focusing on retrieval augmented generation and agentic use cases
- Deeper integration of Oracle Database with Spring, including features like Spring Kafka for Oracle Database Transactional Event Queues.

We’d love to hear from you! Please let us know about your experiences using Spring Cloud Oracle, and what else you would like to see supported by opening an issue in our GitHub repository.

## More great stuff to check out

If you are building Spring Boot applications with Oracle Database, you should also check out [Oracle Backend Microservices and AI](https://bit.ly/OracleAI-microservices) which simplifies the task of building, testing, and operating microservices platforms for reliable, secure, and scalable enterprise applications on any cloud or on your own infrastructure.

If you'd like to try it out yourself, [CloudBank AI](https://bit.ly/cloudbankAI) is a great way to learn more.  It's a free self-paced hands-on lab that shows you how to build Spring Boot microservices and covers topics like REST, asynchronous services with JMS, storing data in Oracle, service discovery, using Spring Actuator for monitoring, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, OpenTelemetry and Jaeger, implementing the saga pattern with Long Running Actions, exposing services using APISIX API Gateway and building an AI ChatBot using Ollama.

Don't miss the Oracle AI Microservices Sandbox (in developer preview). The Oracle AI Microservices Sandbox provides a streamlined environment where developers and data scientists can explore the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. By integrating Oracle Database 23ai AI Vector Search, the Sandbox enables users to enhance existing Large Language Models (LLMs) through RAG. The Oracle AI Microservices Sandbox is available to install in your own environment, which may be a developer's desktop, on-premises data center environment, or a cloud provider. It can be run either on bare-metal, within a container, or in a Kubernetes Cluster. For more information, including more details on Setup and Configuration please visit the [documentation](https://oracle-samples.github.io/oaim-sandbox/).
